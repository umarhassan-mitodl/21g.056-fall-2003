We investigate how German cinema captured the atmosphere of the immediate post-war years and discuss extensively major works of the \"New German Cinema\" of the Sixties and Seventies. We also look at examples of East Germany's film production and finally observe the very different roads German cinema has been taking from the 1990's into the present.\n",
